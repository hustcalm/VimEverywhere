VimEverywhere
=============

To use VIM everywhere, as an Editor, an IDE, a plugin for Firefox, even as an OS.

Typically, we will talk about VIM, .vimrc, vimperator, etc. Feel free to add comment and do contribution to this project,
since we are all geek vimers:-)

## VIM as an Editor
*   [vimrc from amix](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
*   [vimrc from hustcalm forked from amix](https://github.com/hustcalm/vimrc)

## VIM as an IDE
I'd like to make some enhancement to [vimrc](https://github.com/hustcalm/vimrc) and have a plan to make it as a super IDE for newbies and professionals.

Basically, we will get a **File Explorer**, an **Auto Completion**, fast **Moving around**, graceful **Shortcuts**, esay **Extension**, etc.

## VIM as a Browser
*   [vimperator for Firefox](http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator)
*   [pentadactyl(original called vimperator) for Firefox](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/)
*   [vimium for Chrome](http://vimium.github.io/)

## VIM as an OS
coming...
